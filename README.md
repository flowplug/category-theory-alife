This python code provides the algorithm and some of the code to accomplish the artificial
life modelling suggested in Andrew Digh's paper in the file Digh-Greek-Literacy.pdf. The file
digh_vocal.py uses the algorithm described in marnfix.pdf to simulate artificial humans
speaking Greek. The simulations do not include written Greek as Digh had hoped for. I am 
looking for collaborators who might extend the results presented to include written Greek,
or also might have other uses for the code. The file simpleDigh.py is a simplified rendition
of the algorithm in marnfix as it does not include a spanning path and it uses only the single
transition table supplied in Digh's paper, and employs only three organisms.
As far as other uses of the code, please read writing-as-technolgy.pdf. This document 
identifies a missing mathematics of writing, but does not fully describe the missing
mathematics. A part of the missing math is the study of the dispersion of the technology 
with artificial life modeling, which this beginning code is intended to initiate.
This is part of the study of writing at a group level. Also missing is much work on characterisitcs
of writing within the individual. I have coded some of the models given in Eliasmith's 1991
"Neural Engineering" as a starting point in this regard.
   I am new to Category Theory. Would somebody please let me know if the induced function
in ACT-artificial-life.pdf is correctly constructed as a product? Maybe a co-product would have
been correct. Anyway, the document does have graphs of the data produced by digh_vocal.py.
   There appear to be significant errors in Digh's computed results, details upon request.
